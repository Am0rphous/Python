  # Size 0 will read the ENTIRE file into memory!
  m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0, prot=mmap.PROT_READ) #File is open read-only

  # Proceed with your code here -- note the file is already in memory
  # so "readine" here will be as fast as could be
  data = m.readline()
  while data:
    # Do stuff
    data = m.readline()
